    	<p>Miami - This time, nature tipped its hat, and Diana Nyad finally conquered the 110-mile passage from Cuba to Florida that had bedeviled her for 35 years. Sharks steered clear, currents were friendly, and storms took most of the Labor Day weekend off.</p>

        <h2>Diana Nyad completes Cuba to Florida swim</h2>

        <p>The 64-year-old endurance swimmer emerged dazed and sunburned from the surf on Smathers Beach in Key West, Fla., just before 2 p.m. on Monday after nearly 53 hours in the ocean, a two-day, two-night swim from her starting point in Havana. She had survived the treacherous Florida Straits, a notorious stretch of water brimming with sharks, jellyfish, squalls and an unpredictable Gulf Stream. And she became the first person to do so unaided by the protection of a shark cage.</p>

		<p>It was her fifth attempt, coming after four years of grueling training, precision planning and single-minded determination. Her face scorched and puffy from so many hours in the salt water, she leaned on one of her friends and said from the beach:</p>

		<blockquote>I have three messages. One is we should never, ever give up. Two is you never are too old to chase your dreams. Three is it looks like a solitary sport, but it takes a team.</blockquote>

        <p>Coming at an age when few people try to set endurance records, Ms. Nyadâ€™s swim lit up Twitter and Facebook with postings about perseverance and grit, including a tweet from President Obama:</p>

        <blockquote>Congratulations to Diana Nyad. Never give up on your dreams.</blockquote>
